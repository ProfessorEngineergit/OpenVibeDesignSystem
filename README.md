# OpenVibeDesignSystem
On OpenVibeDesignSystem you can check different styles like specific types of glassmorphism etc. to create your own, unique, high quilty design. This then gets transferred into a combined prompt for a vibe coding-agent. The prompt will include html and (I checked) css-snippets, mostly from UIverse, that are of exceptional high quality.
